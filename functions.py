# first of all their are two types of funtions
# 1 built in functions 
# ex: print(), upper() etc
# user defined functions 
# ex: def

# fuctions udes to provide readability and changable

# we can define a function using deg keyboard followed
# by function name with paranthesis this is also called as creating a functions
# writing a function defining a function.

# A constructor is used initialize an object’s state. In Python, _init_ behaves like a constructor for a class.
# _init_ is called whenever a classes’ object is created.
# self represents a class’s instance and is required to access any variables or methods within the class.
# instance means example


v = function(5,6)
print(v)



# invoke means
